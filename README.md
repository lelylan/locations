# Locations API

Locations API for Lelylan. 

#### Notes

This API has been dismissed to focus on a more solic and clean core of microservices. Adding a location API is something we find really useful, but need to be well structured to not mess up the whole architecture. If interested on using it in your projects [let us know](mailto:touch@lelylan.com).
